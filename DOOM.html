            I thought you would appreciate the sentry I chose. The great Agaddon Hunters from the Telos Realm, though long thought to be extinct, created to hunt only the Slayer and his Night Sentinels during the Unholy Crusade... Some improvements on the design have been made; enjoy what is undoubtedly my finest work
